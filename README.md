# LinkedIn Zoomer: Because Subtlety is Overrated

## What is this?

LinkedIn Zoomer is a revolutionary browser extension that solves the age-old problem of not being able to see every pore on your professional connections' faces. We believe that true networking happens when you can count the individual hairs in someone's eyebrows.

## Features

- Transforms all profile pictures into a work of modern art
- Ensures you never miss a single detail in anyone's selfie
- Adds an element of surprise to your LinkedIn browsing experience

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Build the extension with `pnpm build`
4. Load it into your browser
5. Watch your professional life transform before your very eyes

## Usage

Simply browse LinkedIn as you normally would, but prepare for a whole new level of "professional" interaction. Remember, if you can't see what your connection had for breakfast through their profile picture, you're not zoomed in enough.

## Privacy

We respect your privacy as much as this extension respects personal space. Which is to say, not at all.

## Disclaimer

We are not responsible for any lost connections, restraining orders, or existential crises that may result from using this extension. Use at your own risk.

## Contributing

Found a way to zoom even further? Want to add a feature that automatically comments "Nice picture!" on every post? We welcome all contributions, no matter how unnecessary they may seem!
